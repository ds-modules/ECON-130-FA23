    "* Select a cell by clicking on it. \n",
    "    * If you single-click the cell, you will see a blue bar on the left. That means you are in *command mode*. You'll be able to see the Cell type in the dropdown list at the top of the page and you can use command mode keyboard shortcuts. You will not be able to edit the contents of the cell. Pressing `Esc` while in edit mode will take you into command mode.\n",
    "    * If you double-click the cell, you'll instead enter *edit mode*. The bar at the left will be green and you will be able to edit the contents of the cell. Pressing `Enter` while in command mode will take you into edit mode.\n",
    "* Create a  new cell by clicking the `+` icon at the top of the screen (under `File`) or by using the `Insert` menu.\n",
    "    * In command mode, you can also press `a` to create a new cell above the current cell or `b` to create a new cell below.\n",
    "* Write R script by selecting the option \"Code\" from the dropdown list, or write text by selecting \"Markdown\"\n",
    "* Run code by selecting a cell (edit and command mode both work) and pressing \"Run\"\n",
    "    * You can also use `control+enter` (it may be `command+enter` on mac) to run a cell, or `shift+enter` to run a cell and automatically select the next cell\n",
    "    * When code is running, you will see an asterisk * to the left of the cell. When it is finished, you will see a number (ex. In [4] is finished; In [*] is still running).\n",
    "* To clear your coding output, select Cell=>All Output=>Clear from the toolbar at the top of the page\n",
    "* Jupyter notebooks automatically save periodically, but you can also force it to save with `control+s` (or `command+s`), or by clicking the disk icon under `File`.\n",
    "    * You can view the save status at the top of the page next to the notebook name\n",
    "* **IMPORTANT: Close a notebook by selecting `File`=>`Close and Halt`. Don't just close the tab! You might lose your progress.**\n",
    "* Some useful guides are here:\n",
    "    * [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for pretty text like in this cell\n",
    "    * [Jupyter Notebook Keyboard Shortcuts](https://towardsdatascience.com/jypyter-notebook-shortcuts-bf0101a98330)\n",
    "        * You can also access keyboard shortcuts by pressing `h` while in command mode\n",
